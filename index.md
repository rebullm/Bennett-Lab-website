We will develop and evaluate criteria and CDS tools consistent with the NIH-supported FAIR principles. Whenever possible,  
we will use open-source (reusability) and cross-platform (interoperability) analytic software. We will
share that software on GitHub (accessibility) with digital object identifiers (findability).

Our mentoring mission is to nurture a diverse pipeline of talented and well-trained clinicians and non-clinicians engaged in Patient Oriented Research (POR) using
informatics methods. We strongly believe that organizations with diverse membership are more innovative and serve their communities better, therefore we are passionate
recruiting women and those of underrepresented backgrounds to academic medicine and POR and helping them be successful and grow into mentors themselves.
